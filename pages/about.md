### About me
Hi, I’m a husband to one talented designer, father to two fun kids, and born in the 20th century. I played the original Zelda, and I still think time travel is possible. 
When I don’t know what something is, I **Google**. When I don’t know how to do something, I **ChatGPT**. I think of both tools as people with personalities who know and don't know things.

### About this blog
My goal with this blog is to learn about AI tools and become a better writer. To readers it should provide one perspective from working on personal projects. I focus on workflows and insights rather than technical details because this is about becoming the productive worker of tomorrow. Technical details can come from **[Google](https://google.com?q=what%20are%20the%20technical%20details)** or **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?prompt=summarize%20chatgpt%20in%20two%20paragraphs)**.
There are no deadlines or schedules, so I work on what comes naturally. Right now, I’m working on three projects:

- ✍️ A blog about navigating modern tools, productivity, and much less about actual furniture with a retro soul
    - Practical Deep Learning for Coders lessons
    - Random AI projects
- 📱 An app (some details coming...)  
    - Shopify API
    - Flutter
    - OTA programming
    - ESP32 micropython programming
- 🛒 An e-commerce site built with Shopify 
    - Shopify
    - SEO
    - Google Analytics
