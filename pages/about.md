## About me
Hi, I‚Äôm a husband to one talented designer, father to two fun kids, and born in the 20th century. I played the original Zelda, and I still think time travel is possible. 
When I don‚Äôt know what something is, I **Google**. When I don‚Äôt know how to do something, I **ChatGPT**. I write like both tools are people with personalities who know and don't know things.

## About this blog
My goal with this blog is to learn about AI tools and become a better writer. To readers it should provide one perspective from working on personal projects. I focus on workflows and insights rather than technical details because this is about becoming the productive worker of tomorrow. Readers can get better technical details from **[Google](https://google.com?q=what%20are%20the%20technical%20details)** or **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?prompt=summarize%20chatgpt%20in%20two%20paragraphs)**.
There are no deadlines or schedules, so I work on what comes naturally. Right now, I‚Äôm working on three projects:

- ‚úçÔ∏è A blog about navigating modern tools, productivity, and much less about actual furniture with a retro soul
    - Practical Deep Learning for Coders lessons
    - Random AI projects
- üì± An app (some details coming...)  
    - Shopify API
    - Flutter
    - OTA programming
    - ESP32 micropython programming
- üõí An e-commerce site built with Shopify 
    - Shopify
    - SEO
    - Google Analytics
    - Image classifiers
    - AI Agents
