description: Learn more about the creator behind Funiture World – a blog about becoming the productive worker of tomorrow.

Hi, I’m a husband to one, father to two, and born in the 20th century. I played the original **Zelda**, and I still think time travel is possible. My goal with this blog is to learn and become a better writer.

Right now, I’m working on three projects:

- ✍️ A blog about furniture, productivity, and navigating modern tools with a retro soul  
- 📱 An app (some details coming...)  
- 🛒 An e-commerce site built with Shopify 

When I don’t know what something is, I **Google**. When I don’t know how to do something, I **ChatGPT**. I think of both as poeple with personalities who know and don't know things.

Thanks for stopping by. More posts to come with the progress.
